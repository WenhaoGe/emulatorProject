<p>
    Welcome to the Intersight Emulator Farm, this service allows users to start and manage emulated device connector instances for
    the purposes of testing the Intersight service and device connector process at scale.
</p>

<h1>
    Supported emulator types.
</h1>

<ul>
    <li>UCSFI Device Connector</li>
    <li>IMCM5 Device Connector</li>
    <li>HX Device Connector</li>
    <li>Data Spewer</li>
</ul>

<h1>
    Starting a Device connector emulator
</h1>
<p>
    All operations supported by this service are exposed as REST APIs.
</p>
<p>

To start a device connector emulator send an HTTP POST request to:
    http://intersight-emulator-farm.cisco.com:30001/Emulators?namespace=&ltnamespace&gt
</p>

<p>
Where "namespace" is a unique string you wish to place your resources under e.g. "scale-test-50"
</p>

<p>

The body of the request should be a json document with the following properties:<br>
<ul>
    <li>
Name :      A prefix to assign to the emulator name, used to identify individual emulator instances.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
    Platform:   The emulator platform to create. Supported values:<br>
                    UCSFI      : UCS Fabric Interconnect device connector emulator.<br>
                    IMCM5      : Standalone M5 server device connector emulator.<br>
                    HX         : HyperFlex device connector emulator.<br>
                    SCALE_CONN : Data spewer capable of emulating large number of device connections.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
    Version:  The version of the emulator to create. <br>
    </li>
    <li>
    Cloud:    The cloud DNS to register device to. Value must be the southbound (service) dns.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
    Count:    Number of emulator instances to create.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
    CPU:      CPU limit for the emulator.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
    Memory:   Memory limit for the emulator.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
    Options:  Additional environment variables to add to the emulator. Specific to each platform type (documented below)<br>
    </li>
</ul>

    example creation of a UCSFI connector registered to QA cloud.<br>
    {<br>
        "Name":"ucsfi-test",<br>
        "Platform":"UCSFI",<br>
        "Version":"1.0.9-2740",<br>

<ol>
    <li>
EMU_CONNECTIONS : Number of connections to spawn
    </li>
    <li>
    EMU_PLATFORM : Platform to emulate. All platform types supported by the target cloud are supported, however some
               platforms may not support the full feature set of Intersight.
               Current platform support (if platform is not specified here only the base features of register/connect/claim are supported):<br>
                UCSFI: <ul>
        <li>Full inventory support when DB_NAME is specified</li>
        <li>UCSM statistic publish.</li>
                        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>

    EMU_DISCONNECT_RATE : Rate of disconnects in millisconds (default : no disconnects). If specified all spawned connections will be broken
                      at this interval.
    </li>
    <li>

    RECONNECT_RATE : Rate in milliseconds to attempt connection re-connect (default : 10 seconds) if connections are broken for any reason.
    </li>
    <li>


    HONOR_SERVER_BACKOFF : Flag marks whether to honor server backoff requests (default: true)
    </li>
    <li>

    SPAWN_RATE : Rate in milliseconds to spawn new connections. Controls the rate of register when the spewer instance is created.
             Can be used to spread out connections over a period of time to limit impact on Intersight services.
    </li>
    <li>

    JOB_RATE : Rate in milliseconds to run jobs in the job scheduler plugin (default to cloud request)
    </li>
    <li>

    DB_NAME : Database to pull inventory from (default no inventory). Currently only supported for UCSFI platform types.<br>
            UCSFI values:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>small-setup : A relatively small UCSM cluster.</li>
            <li>scale-rack  : A scale UCSM setup containing a 'large' amount of rack servers. (how many you ask? try it out yourself)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
STREAM_INTERVAL: Controls the rate at which streams in the stream plugin will emit a message. Currently the only use case
                 is to control the rate at which stats are published to Intersight. Defaults to value in stream open request.
    </li>
</ol>
<h1>Checking emulator status</h1>
<p>
    The status of spawned emulators can be retrieved with a GET request on:
</p>
<p>
http://intersight-emulator-farm.cisco.com:30001/Emulators?namespace=&ltnamespace&gt
</p>

<p>

    Where "namespace" is the unique string used to spawn the emulators.
</p>

<p>

    An optional query parameter 'claim=yes' can be added to the request to return the claim code and device id that
    can be used to claim the emulator in the Intersight service.
</p>

<h1>Removing emulators</h1>
<p>
    Emulators can be removed, deleting the container and removing all config/resources of the emualtor with a DELETE request:

</p>
<p>
http://intersight-emulator-farm.cisco.com:30001/Emulators/&ltemulator-name&gt?namespace=&ltnamespace&gt
</p>

<p>

    Where "namespace" is the unique string used to spawn the emulators and 'emulator-name' is the name assigned to the instance,
    and returned as the key in the list of objects returned in a GET.
</p>

<p>

    All emulators in a given namespace can be removed at once by sending the DELETE request without specifying a specific
    instance:
</p>

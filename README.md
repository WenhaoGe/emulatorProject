# emulatorProject

Emulator is a software-based implementation. It emulates the Cisco UCS hardware environment. It responds to queries just like hardware. It is container based. It is very easy to be registered at Intersight and start using it. 


## Why do we need to develop emulators?
In order to save cost. Acquiring a real physical device is expensive, it needs lots of space in the lab. The second reason is platform emulator gives customers hands-on experience of manipulating the Cisco UCS configuration and fully understanding Cisco UCS configurations without making any changes to their production environment. The third reason is development teams can use the emulator to test features quickly and manipulate the properties. And test teams can use it to do the scalability tests. Marketing and training teams can use emulators for demo and training and reset the emulators.
